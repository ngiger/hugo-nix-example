# Setup

## Installing Nix

If you'd like to follow along this tutorial, then you should have
installed [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) on your system.

Nix can be installed by following the instructions
[here](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html). At the time of writing this
guide, Nix can be installed by simply running `curl
https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh` as a non-root user.

Please note that if you would like to uninstall nix, simply remove the
directory `/nix`.

## Reproducible environment using a git checkout of this repository

Once you have nix and git installed the following sequence of commands should suffice

```
git clone https://github.com/ngiger/hugo-nix-example.git
cd hugo-nix-example
# the next command will read the shell.nix file and execute the commands hugo version and hugo server
niklaus@librem /o/s/hugo-nix-example (master)> nix-shell bootstrap_hugo.nix --command 'hugo version && hugo server'

## Adapting to your needs

Beware that when whenever you changed a *.nix file. You must stop the hugo server (Ctrl-C), leave the nix shell and call `nix-shell bootstrap_hugo.nix --command 'hugo server'` again.

when you change text elsewhere, eg. content/post/another-blog.md you should see the changed output almost immediately.

https://kalbas.it/2019/02/26/manage-a-static-website-with-hugo-and-nix/ describes some details of the setup via nix and how the themes were installed.
